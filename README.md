Diamond Cat Rocket

Title: Asteroid Belt

Intent: It is a space-themed game (Rocket) that draws inspiration from Flappy Bird, Asteroids (obviously), and the Chrome Dinosaur game. The goal is to get the highest score (go the longest time) without hitting an asteroid. Once you hit an Asteroid the game resets. You control the rocket by moving the mouse up and down within the window. The intent was to make a game similar to Flappy Bird but with zero gravity, and to score it like the Chrome No-Internet game.

Narrative structure: You are the astronaut-pilot in charge of the Diamond-Cat Rocket. Usually you encounter smooth sailing as you venture throughout the galaxy, but trouble arises when you encounter an unexpected asteroid belt! You must navigate through the space-rocky environment without hitting a single one, or else your whole crew will face an untimely experience in the vacuum of space... FOREVER.

Mechanics: Simple mouse controls. Just drag the cursor up and down to control the rocket. Meant for a browser.

Aesthetics: Our images are from the Open Game Art site. They are space themed, of course. The goal was to have similar art style throughout the game.

Joys: We had an enjoyable --and relatively easy-- time making the rocket go up and down on the screen and making the asteroids come in from the right and rotate. So the base mechanics were a pleasant experience.

Struggles: However, we found trouble with collisions and score-keeping. As these two mechanics effected the entire game and required lots of tedious rearanging of code to avoid error messages.

To begin making the game, we met in the library and each individually took lead on a different mechanic for the game. Gabby made the rocket mechanics, allowing it to go up and down. Additionally, she set up the scorekeeping system. Tucker set up the asteroid mechanics, making the prefab approach, delete, and rotate. Afterwards, Tucker combined the code as the files had overwritten eachother some. In following days, Gabby set the basis for collisions and Tucker refined any collision to reset the game. Gabby then fixed scorekeeping to reset correctly on a game reset and Tucker wrote the ReadMe file. Gabby uploaded the game to itch.io.
